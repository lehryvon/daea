      <h1>Elephantine</h1>
      <h3>Predynastic to the Ptolemaic Period</h3>
	  <h4>by Ryan Hiltunen</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>In Upper Egypt, at the far southern reaches of the Nile, a proud fortress once stood, serving as both a 
		hub for foreign trade as well as a strong defensive position between Egypt and her neighbors to the
		south, the Nubians. Overseen by the triad of Khnum, the ancient ram-headed god of the cataracts, the
		isle of Elephantine was once a place of worship and life, housing ancient communities of Egyptians,
		Greeks, Romans, and even Hebrews over its storied lifetime. Lasting from the earliest days of Egyptian
		prehistory to its final dynasties, Elephantine stands as a bulwark amidst the rushing waters of the Nile,
		a testament to the long-lived rule of the ancient Egyptians.</p>
		<br>
	<h3>Geography and Setting</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Elephantine is an island located near the center of the Nile River, part of a group of islands that 
		includes Kitchen's Island to the northwest and Amun Island to the south. It is located downstream of 
		the First Cataract of the Nile, just north of the border between southern Egypt and Nubia. The island is 
		1.2 kilometers in length and about .4 kilometers across at its widest point.  It is also thought to be 
		named after its shape, which is roughly similar to that of an elephant's tusk, or because of the large, 
		smooth gray rocks on the banks of the island that resemble large bathing elephants. These boulders are 
		evidence of the large deposits of granite stone present on the island.
		<br><br>
		The island of Elephantine is now part of the modern city of Aswan; the city proper is located just east of the island on the bank of the Nile.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Site Description</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>The site of the ancient settlement, known by the ancient Egyptians- as well as the island itself- as Abu 
		or Yebu, is located primarily in the southern portion of the island and likely served as as a fortress 
		through much of its history. Not only was it a strategic defensive position with the border of Nubia, 
		however; sediments on Elephantine containing Nubian pottery fragments suggest that it also would 
		have been a vital trade route hub north of the First Cataract of the Nile as far back as the Predynastic 
		period.
		<br><br>

		A majority of the southern portion of the island is occupied by the ruins of the Temple of Khnum and 
		other associated sites, such as ruins of shrines and other structures. A couple of the extant Old 
		Kingdom structures include a 3rd Dynasty granite pyramid and a 6th Dynasty shrine to the local 
		nomarch, Heqaib, whom was deified and worshipped by a cult after his demise. A square basin on the 
		southern tip of the island, near the temple proper would have served as the older and less-used of the 
		two Nilometers on Elephantine.
		<br><br>

		Further to the north of the Temple of Khnum is the restored Temple of Satis, goddess of the 
		Elephantine triad and consort of Khnum. The temple was constructed in the 18th Dynasty during the 
		time of Hatshepsut and Tuthmose III.
		<br><br>
		Alongside the western bank of Elephantine can be found rock-cut tombs of nobles and nomarchs and 
		other important political officials, some dating back to the Old, Middle, and even the new Kingdom. 
		<br><br>

		North of the Aswan Museum on Elephantine is one of the earliest known Nilometers to have been 
		excavated, but the less old of the two found on the island. The stone staircase leads down 90 steps to 
		the river from the entrance, with height markings in hieroglyphic, Roman, and Hindu-Arabic numerals 
		carved along the walls used to measure the height of the Nile floods and forecast the season's levels of 
		inundations. On the outside of the Nilometer are large boulders along the banks of Elephantine with 
		numerous inscriptions, all associated with the names of pharaohs and nomarchs that were involved in 
		some way with the island.
		<br>
	<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>Since 1969 the site has been part of a grand-scale effort by the German Archaeological Institute branch
		in Cairo- along with some support from the Swiss Institute for Architectural and Archaeological 
		Research on Ancient Egypt- to investigate and reconstruct the various structures on the island.
		<br><br>
		The largest of these structures still standing today is the Temple of Khnum, located on the southern end
		of the island. The structure dates back to the 3rd Dynasty, but archaeological evidence suggests that it 
		was completed in the 18th Dynasty rule of Pharaoh Hatshepsut. In previous seasons the German-Swiss 
		Mission to Elephantine uncovered more structures built during the New Kingdom, including columns 
		and large areas which may have served as a grand ritual hall for Amenhotep II.  
		<br><br>
		In the south-western portion of Elephantine, the remnants of a First Intermediate Period palace have 
		been excavated, the site containing ostraca of distribution lists and mentions of the cult of Heqaib. One 
		section of the site has been determined to have been a large bakery that was likely in uses over several 
		Dynasties, complete with ovens and thousands of bread moulds. The bakery was constructed with 
		octagonal wooden columns, which are some of the earliest preserved examples of these building 
		materials to date.
		<br><br>
		Under the guidance of Doctor Gunter Dreyer in the 1970s and 1980s, excavations on the Temple of 
		Satis have lead to a unique discovery about the site: likely due to space restrictions with the boulders 
		surrounding the site, the 18th Dynastic builders of the temple built the structure on the site of an even 
		earlier shrine by simply filling the site in and paving over it. Further excavations proved that this 
		process occurred multiple times, with the final standing 18th Dynasty temple being built over the 
		remains of an 11th or 12th Dynasty temple, which itself was built upon the site of an even earlier 
		possibly 6th dynasty temple. Due to the nature of the earliest shrine's sealing, the structure of the older 
		shrine and the artifacts contained within were well-preserved and offered a fairly complete look at what 
		the shrine might have looked like, dating back to its construction in the Early Dynastic period. Among 
		the artifacts found in the tomb were things such as human figures (both adult and children, though 
		mostly of children and one that might have represented a king sitting down bearing the sign of the 1st 
		dynasty Pharaoh Djer), numerous figures of animals (birds, frogs, crocodiles, lions, pig, hippos, cats, 
		and hedgehogs), flint knives, and a number of faience (a blue-green glazed material) objects such as 
		plaques bearing animal head shapes, wall tiles, beads, necklace spacers, and model pots. 
		<br><br>
		North of the Temple of Satis, a giant Late Period mudbrick tomb was discovered and found to house 
		the  mummified bodies of the royal rams. These would have been considered sacred on the isle of 
		Elephantine, where the patron deity was the ram-headed god Khnum. 
		<br><br>
		Over time, the numerous expeditions performed on Elephantine have uncovered a number of unique 
		artifacts. One such artifact is an ancient Egyptian calendar dating back to the New Kingdom during the 
		rule of Thutmose III, often colloquially referred to in modern times as the “Elephantine Calendar of 
		Things”. Though the full thing is now on display at the Aswan Museum on the island of Elephantine, 
		the calendar itself was fragmented and scattered when it was first discovered.
		<br><br>
		Also discovered during excavations of Elephantine are a series of manuscripts and letters written on 
		papyrus that are often referred to as the Elephantine papyri. Caches have been discovered containing 
		hundreds of these documents and span the period of about 1000 years, written in Hieratic and Demotic 
		Egyptian, Aramaic, Greek, Latin, and Coptic, neatly representing the entire retinue of those different 
		groups that occupied Elephantine at any given time. The most numerous of the papyri are written in 
		Aramaic and document a Jewish community (possibly mercenaries, as there are detailed accounts of 
		living among soldiers on the island) stationed at Elephantine during Persian rule from roughly 495 
		BCE until 399 BCE. The Elephantine papyri include legal and work contracts, marriage and divorce 
		documents, letters to family, loan agreements, real estate contracts, and one particular letter which 
		gives instructions on how to properly conduct the Jewish ritual Passover. According evidence in several 
		different documents, it would seem that the Jewish community maintained a temple (referred to as the 
		House of Yaweh) which functioned alongside the Temple of Khnum, at least indicating that Egyptian 
		residents of Elephantine at the time were tolerant of the foreign religious practices.</p>
		<br>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>To conclude, Elephantine island is a fascinating site with a long, varied history with much to tell us 
		from all the different groups that have occupied it. It contains archaeological data from as far back as 
		the Predynastic Period all the way up to the twilight of the Egyptian kingdom in the Ptolemaic Period. 
		Elephantine's ruins run the full range of history, with many different structures all belonging to 
		different periods in the ancient Egyptian timeline. The site proper allows us a glimpse into the past of 
		both an important center of trade as well as a stronghold against potential foreign threats. The constant 
		coming and going of people as well as its long-standing history render this site a cornucopia of 
		information from all sorts of different dynasties and time periods, allowing modern archaeologists the 
		unique opportunity the really observe how an ancient site really changed over time.</p>
