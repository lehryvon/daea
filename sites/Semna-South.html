         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <img src="http://shazlyasmail.tripod.com/fortress.jpg">
		 <p>Semna South fort sits along the Nile River.  The Sudan Antiquities Service began an excavation project in 1956 finishing in 1957 under direction of Professor Jean Vercoutter and Sayed Thabit Hassan Thabit.   The excavation uncovered approximately four-fifths of the inner area of the fort (1).   Professor Vercoutter developed two theories as to the settlement at Semna South.  During the excavations no evidence of any Middle Kingdom building was found leading him to infer that the fort was used as camping ground of the men of the nearby forts or only occupied when a threat was present.  However, a scarab and offering table of the Middle Kingdom were later discovered, leading Vercoutter to consider the possibility that the fort contained a small Middle Kingdom settlement that was later completely destroyed by the Christian occupation.  A second round of excavations took place in 1966 to 1968 by the Oriental Institute Expedition to Sudanese Nubia at the Semna South fort and the adjacent Meroitic cemetery (1).  </p>

		 <h3>Location and Geography</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Semna South fortress is located 43 miles south of Halfa, between Aswan and Khartoum.  Resting along the Nile River, the fort represents Egyptian occupation of ancient Nubia.  The Twelfth Dynasty kings sought to seize goldmines of Sudan and organize the collection of gold, work the copper mines with a royal labor force and control the shipping and boat traffic moving northward (2).  The Egyptian name of the fort, recorded in hieroglyphs on numerous seal impressions, translates into “Subduer of Setiu-Nubians” or “Subduer of Seti-land” (3).  Semna South is one of four mud-brick fortresses built along the Nile at the Semna gorge, the narrowest part of the Nile (4).  Semna South is the southern most of the Semna Cataract forts.  The banks of the river are quite steep, leading up to a rocky, harsh area on which the fort was constructed (5).  The rocky islets of the Nile created a natural dam system allowing for control of river traffic.  Extensive buildings surrounded the fort complexes.  These buildings were strongly fortified and included many barracks (6).  </p>

		 <h3>Description of Site</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Semna south fort sits on irregular low ground.  The inner fortification walls were built in a square plan.  The fort consisted of stone paved glacis-an artificial slope, an outer brick girdle wall, an inner ditch and a main buttressed inner wall separated from the ditch by an artificial terrace.  One of the more significant parts of the construction was the stairway of massive stones that descends from the northeastern corner of the inner area of the fort and tunnels under the main inner wall (1).  This stairway leads to the original edge of the Nile River and has provided insight on the flood conditions during the Middle Kingdom.  The Nile forts accommodated anywhere between 368 and 920 men available to the commander posted at Semna for use during time of emergency or threat (7).  Native (Nubian) cargo vessels wishing to carry their goods northward would be required to stop and transship their goods to Egyptian vessels or to overland expeditions (7).  The upper pool of the Semna cataract was suitable for a ship harbor and a large plain at Semna south provided a staging area for native caravans.  The caravans would wait for official permission from Egypt to leave (7).  </p>

		 <h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The site of Semna South has been excavated in two separate occasions; once in 1956-57 and then again in 1966-1968.  Unfortunately the area is now covered by Lake Nasser as a result from the building of the Aswan High Dam in 1971.  The main part of Semna South is the fortress, erected during various phases of building activity.  The inner area stretches 34.3m by 33m.    Initial excavations uncovered a scarab and offering table dating from the Middle Kingdom.  Beneath the foundations of the fort, black and red sherds covered the dirt.  These sherds indicate a possible proto-dynastic or early dynastic settlement (1).  Surrounding the structures lays a glacis or artificial slope 4m wide and 1.5m deep.  The northeastern wall consisted of a brick wall protected by stone escarpment on its river side and on the other side were traces of a strengthening wall (1).  At the northwest corner, a second wall juts out at a right angle running parallel to the northeastern wall.  Within this corner area, the remains of brick wall and fireplace were discovered.  Sherds collected during excavation again dated to the Middle Kingdom.  In later excavations, a larger area encompassing the fireplace was examined.  An outline of a rectangular building emerged, half of which functioned as a kitchen.  Remains of ashes, hearth-places, storage jars and broken pottery were recovered (1).  One of the more unique features of the fort was the mud-plastered pathways that ran along the four walls enclosing the inner rectangle.  The floor sloped from all sides towards a circular depression in the center into a basin (1).  This feature has been referred to as “libation places” meaning a place to pour a drink as offering to a deity.  Common to many Egyptian constructions, Semna south fort included foundation deposits.  Rough pottery, bowls, miniature dishes and a few beads were left as an offering to ensure the strength and protection of the building (1).  Professor Vercoutter led the 1956-57 excavations and developed the theory of a fortification system.  Brick walls seemingly embraced Semna west and Semna south in the same complex.  Partial excavation of this wall proved it had rested on massively built 2m deep stone substructure (1). </p>
		 <p>Fortunately, due to the trade routes, many sealings have been recovered from Semna south.  The study of these provide a fairly precise timeline.  The earliest sealings discovered bear the cartouche of Sesostris I; no sealings from the reign of Ammeneaes IV were found.  This meant either sealings were no longer used or produced at Semna south or may suggest the fort was no longer occupied</p>
		 <p>Periodically the fort was cleared and broken pottery as well as other discarded objects were transported across the wall and deposited into former quarry holes.  The excavation of 21 of these quarry dumps uncovered numerous items of archaeological value. The sherds dated to Egypt’s Middle Kingdom but included a mix of fragments from the Nubian style.  One of the more impressive discoveries was that of a well preserved XII Dynasty axe (1).  The rare piece was analyzed by Mr. William Young then Director of Research Laboratory of Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  The axe head consists mostly of copper, approximately 80-84% along with a small percentage of lead.  A large quantity of seal impressions of scarabs and stamp seals date the axe to the reign of Sesostris III.  The seal impressions inscriptions included royal names and names of forts.</p>
		 <p>The final section of Semna south excavated was the large cemetery lying just north of the fortress.  Around 800 individuals were laid to rest in the 560 graves spanning the Meroitic period and into the Christian period (1).  Eight graves displayed superstructures resembling mastabas or steep-sided pyramids.  Unlike most Egyptian burial superstructures, those at Semna south contained no niches for offerings and the entrance sat at the west not east side of the grave.  Simpler rectangular graves either had a ramp leading down to an axial chamber or were a basic oblong pit.  Similar to most Egyptian burials, the bodies orientated head to the west and most remains were extended on their back with hands at pubis (1).  Evidence suggests that the some bodies had been wrapped in shrouds and placed in a wooden coffin.  A study of 592 individuals considered the evidence of healed fractures and the possible effects of physical and social environments on trauma incidence (5).  The results concluded that 20.6% of the adults exhibited at least one healed fracture, 17.9% of which were cranial (5).  As expected within the male population the distribution of fractures by age shows a peak in old adults (aged 30-40 years).  However, the females with healed trauma exhibit no significant differences among age groups (5).  26 individuals suffered multiple sites of trauma.  Many of the long bone fractures may be due to falls.  Clavicle fractures involving a direct blow to the top of the shoulder, compound fractures, the high frequency of ulnar trauma and tibial fractures can be explained by falls possibly along the rocky edge of the Nile River (5).  In conjunction with the human remains, many other types of objects were recovered from the burial sites.  Vessels made of pottery in form of cups, bowls, bottles and jars decorated using paints (red, black and white) and the comb-pick method were among the artifacts.  Also copper and bronze bowls, wooden bowls, glass ointment jar, toilet equipment and tools, bronze mirrors, copper, iron and bronze rings, bronze and gold plated earrings, beads, hunting equipment, leather sandals, bags and quivers and shrouds made of linen, wool and cotton were also recovered (1).  </p>

		 <h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The significance of the archaeological excavations at Semna south manifests in a greater understanding of the Egyptian occupation of Nubia and the lives of the people both conquered and conquerors.  Historical inscriptions on a stele uncovered at the fortresses of both Semna and Kuma records the conquests of Usertesen III in the region (6).  A second stele discovered at the Semna gorge erected by Senusret III spelled out the Egyptian’s complete control over the northern Nubians (4).  An inscription of Sesostris III declared a standing order at Semna that Nubians from upriver should be allowed to go down as far as Iqen (near the of the 2nd cataract) only if they wished to trade, otherwise they must turn back (2).  This precaution against raiding reveals a possible weakness in Egyptian control while the previous two stele inscriptions portrayed dominance over Nubia.  Despite the obvious conquest of Egypt, some archaeological evidence suggests a more peaceful coexistence.  As previously mentioned, the quarry dumps at Semna south contained both Egyptian and Nubian sherds and pottery fragments (1).  The combination of styles from the same general time period would suggest that both Egyptians and Nubians lived along this stretch of the Nile.  The function of the fort is recorded in what are called the Semna dispatches (7).  The dispatches record the direct trade with native merchants sailing northward from southern Nubia.  Semna south was a bustling center for trade.  The number of arriving vessels was greater than the capability to ship northward suggesting that the fort must have had facilities to store goods (7).  The analysis of more than 120 of the fragmentary grave textiles revealed well-developed techniques in spinning, dyeing and weaving (1).  The extensive wall stretching from Semna south to Semna west strengthens the view that the military installations at Semna built by the Egyptians were a response to pressures from the south (1).  The massive stairway which led down to the edge of the Nile also provided an interesting insight to the climate of the area during the Middle Kingdom.  The stairs were covered in layers of Nile silt.  This indicates that the Nile River flooded, either due to high inundation or the daming of the river. </p>

		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The fortress and surrounding structures at Semna south are among the multitude of Egyptian forts along the Nile River in northern Nubia.  Semna south represents Egypt’s occupation of the land throughout the Middle Kingdom and its relation to the native peoples.  Trade was a massive part of the Egyptian kingdom and one of the major motivators for the invasion and conquering of Nubian land.  Archaeological evidence from Semna south reveals the trade system and control of boat traffic along the Nile.  Steles and seal impressions document the occupation from a political view while cultural artifacts such as pottery and other craft goods represent the social occupation of the area.  </p>
