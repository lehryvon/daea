      <h1>El Kurru</h1>
      <h3>25th Dynasty in the Third Intermediate Period</h3>
	  <h4>Julia Breza</h4>



<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr>
<p> El Kurru is the site of a royal necropolis that contains the burials of five Nubian Pharaohs and their families.  El Kurru has a number of notable features that sets it apart from other Egyptian archaeological sites; a diverse collection of pyramids that look nothing like their northern cousins, twenty four horse tombs and large variety of mortuary building styles from crude to ornate.  This site remained untouched until in 1918 when the archaeologist George Reisner decided to cross the Nile from his current excavation to check out the crumbling remains of a pyramid. Currently excavations are being done at this site by archaeologist Geoff Emberling from the University of Michigan.    
</p>

<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
<hr>
<p> El Kurru is located in Nubia. Nubia is a geographical area where the people share a common culture as opposed to a political entity.  Nubia is not located in the northern region of Sudan.   In ancient times Nubia was the located south of the Egyptian empire.  To the Egyptians, keeping close ties to the Nubians was of opt most importance. The Nubian area was rich with precious minerals including gold and myrrh.  They also supplied Egypt with exotic animals, pelts, and feathers.  The iconic image of an Egyptian priest wearing a leopard skin would not be possible if not for trade relations between Nubians and Egyptians. The figure on the far left in this photo shows a priest draped in his leopard skin attire while performing the opening on the mouth ceremony on the deceased.  </p>
<img src=“http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Opening_of_the_mouth_ceremony.jpg” style=”float:left”>

<p> At the height of the Egyptian rule in the New Kingdom, Nubia as a separate entity disappears from Egyptian records.  During the New Kingdom, Egypt was expanding its borders in all directions. It is lead to believe that Nubia became absorbed into the Egyptian empire at this time.  Further evidence of this can be found in the tombs of Nubians from this time.  Tombs in Nubia contained iconic tomb paintings depicting the deceased in traditional Egyptian clothing and participating in many iconic scenes that are often found thought of as classic Egyptian. To see a visual comparison, the photo on the left is from the tomb of Tanutamani in El Kurru where as the photo on the right is from an older Egyptian tomb.  The similarities between the two show an aspect of the Egyptian culture that was transferred to the Nubians. </p>

<p> Other evidence includes the mortuary buildings themselves.  In the New Kingdom, Egyptian Pharaohs were no longer being buried in grand pyramids and temples.  Instead they were laid to rest in the Valley or the Kings or the Valley of the Queens.  Even though many tombs were found at El Kurru and other Nubian burial sites, they also brought back the practice of pyramid building. The picture on the left is from Begarawiyah, a site that is close to El Kurru.  They pyramids there are smaller than ones found in Egypt, and the sides are much steeper.  The picture on the right is of the remains of a pyramid at El Kurru. </p>

<p> One of the only distinguishable features that set the Nubians apart from Egyptians once they had adopted Egyptian culture was the color of their skin.  The Nubian pharaohs are more commonly referred to as the ‘Black Pharaohs’ due to being depicted with very dark skin in tomb paintings.  The end of the New Kingdom marked the decline of the strong central government of Egypt.  The vast empire that was formed by the Pharaohs during the New Kingdom was slowly breaking away back into their former nations. This period of separation is referred to as the third intermediate period in Egyptian history. It was during this period that the Nubian Pharos came to power and ruled over the divided Egyptian empire.  The Nubian family that reigned during tis period made up the 25th dynasty of Egypt.(3)  </p>

<p>"Nubia was the meeting place of the Mediterranean and African civilization. The relationship between Egypt and upper Nubia was completely different from time to time and period to period. If the Egyptian king's power is widespread it catches everything under its control and Nubia comes under Egyptian authority, but if it is weak, then upper Nubia is ruled by itself."
-Osama Abdel Meguid, Director of the Nubian Museum in Aswan. </p>

<h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr>
<p> There are six pharaohs that are considered to have ruled during the 25th dynasty.  At the site of El Kurru, only five of the six pharos of this dynasty were buried; Taharqo was buried at Nuri.</p>
<p> Kashta: 760-747 BCE</p>
<p> Piye: 747-716 BCE</p>
<p> Shabaqo: 716-702 BCE</p>
<p> Shebitqo: 702-690 BCE</p>
<p> Taharqo: (buried at Nuri):  690-664 BCE</p>
<p> Tanutamani: 664-653 BCE </p>
<p> The site of El Kurru is located on the Nile between the third and forth cataracts. The site is easily divided into three different sections by two wadies the ‘North Wady’ and the ‘South Wady’. In between these two wadies is where the Pharaohs are buried.    Shabaqo Shebitqo and Tanutamani are buried in pyramids, it is known if the monument that was build for Piye was a pyramid or mastaba.  Unlike Egyptian pyramids, each pharaoh was buried in a tomb that was cut into the bedrock with a pyramid substructure built on top of it.  It is unknown where Kashta was buried at, but there is a mastaba (mastaba VIII) that is one of the oldest and most important according to Reiner.  Reiner concludes that mastaba VIII is that of Kashta, but there is no evidence besides this.  The other graves that are in this section are that of distinguished family members from before the reign of Piye. </p>
<p> Above the North Wady contains the burials of five women, supposable queens.  In the South Wady contains nine tombs.  Five of these tombs are separated from the others; four are very similar in nature as to suggest that they were built at the same time, the fifth one sat behind the other four and belonged to Tabary – ‘the foremost great wife of the king of his majesty, Piankhy (Piye)’.  The other four burial in this area are in pairs; each one is a stairway tomb that are less grand than the ones found in the Northern Wady.(2)

<h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p> George Reisner 1918-1920</p>
<p> George Reisner is credited with the discovery of the El Kurru site as well as being the first archaeologist to work there. Reisner stumbled upon El Kurru quite by accident; he was working in Nuri where he discovered the tomb of Taharqo. He found it extremely odd that only one 25th dynasty grave was located at Nuri.  From the position of Nuri on the Nile, he could make out shapes in the distance that vaguely resembled pyramids across the Nile River and decided to move his excavation to that spot.  What he uncovered at that new location (El Kurru) was the rest of Taharqo’s family and the final resting place of the Nubian rulers of Egypt during the 25th dynasty.(2)</p>
<br>
<p> Geoff Emberling 2013 - Current</p>
<p> The current excavation at El Kurru is being conducted by The University of Michigan Archaeology Department. This excavation started in 2013 and is headed by Geoff Emberling, a research scientist at University of Michigan.  The hope of this excavation is to relocate an ancient city in the El Kurru area. To date, the excavation team has uncovered part of the ancient city’s wall, a rock cut well and a temple complex complete with underground rooms and chambers. (1)</p>

<h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p> George Reisner 1918-1920</p>
<p> George Reisner was an American Archaeologist who became the head of the Egyptology department at Harvard. Reisner worked in the Sudan recoding archaeological sites that might be harmed by the building of the Aswan Dam.  His work in Sudan led him to the site of El Kurru where he spent his 1918 through 1920 seasons. During the two years that he spent at El Kurru, Reisner worked to indentify the owners of the pyramids, mastabas, and tombs.  He also worked out the family bold line that connected the different family members to each other based on their burial location.  Another large contribution that Reisner’s work included was many descriptions of sites that he did not have time to excavate.  These descriptions are now being used by Geoff Emberling as a basses for his excavations at El Kurru. (2)</p>
<br>
<p> Geoff Emberling 2013 - Current</p>
<p> Although Geoff Emberling has only begun his work at El Kurru, he has had a profound impact on the academic world’s knowledge and understanding of the 12th dynasty pharaohs. Little was known about these six pharaohs that ruled Egypt during this turbulent time, nor has much focus been placed on this site until now.</p>
<p> The results of Geoff Emberling’s excavations in his 2013 season, also his first season at El Kurru, were more about locating a series of structures that had been described in George Reisner’s field notes from almost a century earlier. He has five specific structures that he and his team were hoping to find: a section of a city wall, a well with sounding staircase a stone fortification wall, and two mortuary temples. During this first season, Emberling and his team found four out of the five structures that they hoped to find: The well, the city wall and both of the temples. </p>
<p> He had considerable help in finding these sites; he used a combination of resources to pin point their possible location and then confirmed a specific site against the notes in Reisner’s publication.  He started by using photographs and topographical maps of the area to select a possible location for the sites.  Next he talked to locals whose relatives remember Reisner and the excavations that took place at El Kurru.  The well, for instances, was recorded in Reisner’s notes as to be extending under the wall of the Gab-ullah family home. Emberling and his team talked to people in the area and were able to locate the family in question.  The decedents that still occupied the house were able to show Emberling exactly where the well was located. </p>
<p> After his first season at El Kurru, Emberling and his team completed many preliminary surveys as well as setting the foundation for the field school that will be there for many seasons to come.  His work also caught the attention of National Geographic that has been featuring pictures and stories about this excavation. During his second season at El Kurru, Emberling and his team worked on a pyramid that was recorded by Reisner in his notes but was never excavated. (2)  </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p> The site of El Kurru was very unique it that is was a family resting place.  Only Taharqo, the fifth Pharaoh to rule Egypt in the 24th dynasty, was buried at another site, Nuir.  His predecessor, Tanutamani, returned to the family plot at El Kurru upon his death. The site of El Kurru and the other Sudanese archaeological sites play a very important role in understanding the lives of Egyptians.  From the tomb paintings, artifacts, and records found at El Kurru and neighboring sites show the influence of Egyptian culture on the concurred territories of the Egyptian empire.    </p>
