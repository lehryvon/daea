		  <p>
		  In the city of Abydos, the Temple of Seti I, also known as the Great Temple of Abydos, is located at approximately 26 degrees north by 31 degrees west. It is just one of the many remarkable features and architectural wonders in Abydos. The temple was built as a mortuary, although Seti I is buried in the Valley of the Kings. It is one of the largest and most complex sites in the area, constructed on entirely new ground and was consistently updated throughout the years of prestigious ancient Egyptian reign by numerous pharaohs.

		  The site’s location is in the middle of the Upper Egypt about 6 miles (11km) west of the Nile. Abydos is one of the oldest metropolises of Egypt and the site which the temple sits on is thus considered one of the most sacred sites in Egypt not only because of its remarkable age, but also due to its dedication to the god Osiris. The overall climate in Abydos is essentially dry and hot, but depending upon the tides of the Nile River, the climate can be cooler and less dry with greater amounts of foliage; however Abydos tends to be rocky, parched, and arid. Surrounded by numerous exquisite tombs, this temple is one of the oldest and thankfully has not been encroached by the expansion of Modern civilization. Much of the ancient world that was once brilliant and well-maintained at Abydos is now covered by the earth or the modernization of the area or deteriorating in that presence. Egypt’s overall climate is not a fair one when it comes to archaeological and architectural preservation so the building’s materials of sandstone and limestone can wither and decay with excessive exposure. In addition, raids and antiquarianism also effected the site’s preservation, causing the loss of many antiquities. Structural damage by apathetic invaders throughout various times in Egypt’s history also contributed to the breakdown and decay of the temple’s exterior.

		    Description of the Site

		  <p>
		  The Temple of Seti the first is perhaps as magnificent on the inside as it is on the structure’s exterior. The shrine was originally 550 ft (170 m) long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about 250 ft (76 m) long and 350 ft (110 m) wide, including the wing at the side. It is constructed primarily of limestone and sandstone and like so many others in the area, this monument was dedicated to Osiris and was completed during Ramses II’s reign. There are even depictions of King Ramses slaying Asiatics and worshipping Osiris on the walls of the temple. There are depictions of offerings of wine and gold and of the god Osiris sitting on a throne, being served auspiciously. Furthermore, the temple has long, extensive tunnels that flow deep into the earth, quite possibly like a physical path to the underworld, though no bodies were buried at this site. This seems to be the architectural pattern in many temples and more often within tombs. In addition, the temple consisted of a pylon, two open courts, two hypostyle halls, and seven chapels of worship for the principal deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and the most powerful god, Amun-Re; the remaining three chapels are dedicated to the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. Units for food storage and offerings were built on either side of the temple. Numerous depictions within the tomb display the Pharaoh Seti receiving and giving various offerings to the gods. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form of the Daily Ritual, which was performed throughout temples regularly in Egypt throughout the Pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is the Osireion, which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of Osiris as an "Osiris tomb". It is possible that from those chambers led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah, the fourth ruler of the 19th dynasty in Ancient Egypt.  Within the temple is also a “Rite of the Ancestors” which was essentially a list of Pharaohs who were recognized by Seti I.  Despite the details of the temple, the artwork is not depictions of historical events but of religious ones and no historical chronology is portrayed.

		  Numerous additions to the temple were made by future Pharaohs from the Late and Roman periods. The temple surely played an important role to the royal household and family claims that Seti decedents had on the throne. Ramses I, Seti’s father, and Seti himself was a warrior and had no royal blood. Without this claim, he built temples and proved himself through his architectural works and diplomacy that he was worthy of the title Pharaoh, much like his father had. However, Seti I is considered by the Egyptians to have been a legitimate king and ruler. Because seventy-six legitimate kings are listed in the tomb as pharaohs of Egypt, they are seen as the true rulers. Incidentally, those who were not seen as rulers of Egypt were Hatshepsut and Akhenaten. This helped Seti and his descendants with their claim to the throne.

		  One of the most noted excavations taken at this temple is that led by Dorothy Eady. She lived for 1908 to 1981 and was known as the Keeper of the Temple. She led numerous excavations starting in the 1950s when she began translating hieroglyphs from the temple. She believed this monument to Seti was a place of peace and a secure temple where the Gods were ever-present, watching over her as she worked. She was especially well-known for her belief in the idea of her being an Egyptian queen in her past life.

		  Other excavations include those of modern-day archaeologists such as Zahi Hawass who finds the tunnels within the temple to be of primary interest. The layout and organization of the tunnels is said to be a unique one and though not extensive, they are existent and perhaps had some religious symbolisms or purpose. The first excavation was in 1917 by Edouard Naville who excavated not only this temple built on new ground, but also many New Kingdom and Old Kingdom temples dedicated the gods. Because of these excavations, they were able to determine that the importance of Abydos and its relation to the god Osiris is because it is believed that the god was actually buried here. Further excavation has shed light on the age of the hieroglyphs and that the temple was not used to house the corpse of Seti, but instead was constructed by his son Ramses II to honor his father after death. The hieroglyphs date as far back as the 32nd century B.C.

		  Various catalogs of restorations at the temple and explicit and detailed analysis on the figures and hieroglyphs carved inside the temple are published in numerous articles and books including The Monuments of Seti I: Epigraphic, Historical and Art Historical Analysis written by Peter James Brand, Brand describes in detail the overall area, locations, and epigraphy within and without the temple.

		     Conclusion – importance of site & excavations, how it fits into overall Egyptian archaeology (and related to other similar sites), etc. 
		   </title>
		</h1>
      		  <p>
      		  The Temple of Seti I is a magnificent and impressive work of architecture which still stands today, it is a structure that has been updated and built upon for centuries and still has significance today for the historians and archaeologists like Eady who believe that they are being actively watched over by the gods as they work to interpret the temple’s glyphs, art, and overall composition. This temple is an important monument in understanding the theology of Ancient Egypt. It contributes to the understanding of how the pyramids, temples, and other works of architecture were constructed and what significance they may have had whether it was for the living or the dead. Seti’s temple is also an example of urban planning and development during this time and understanding the composition of the temple as well as any artifacts or religious depictions found within the structure, can help to conclude when the temple was built, by whom, why, and how. The significance for Seti’s temple was like so many others dedicated not only to himself but to an important god in the area which helps historians and archaeologists comprehend stories and functions of particular gods such as Osiris.

		  Since Egypt was a full-functioning Eastern and European trading destination and a powerful civilization, it had connections and significance to other countries and people in the surrounding area over the years. As rulers and theocracies shifted, we can see how the temple’s purpose did as well and why this temple was not a later temple, but an earlier one, dedicated to a ruler who did not have any royal blood to his name. It displays the flamboyance of Egypt and the glory and wonder of the vast achievements that they accomplished as a kingdom beneath the gaze of their numerous gods.
