         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Dorginarti Fortress Island is one of the neatly built forts during the Middle and New Kingdom. This fort along with other plays a significant role in defense and trade. The island itself is located on the banks of the Nile between Upper Egypt and the borders of Sudan (Heidorn,1991). Due to its location the fort can be tied to both Egyptian and many other cultures. Many forms of pottery from Sudanese, Persian, Saite and Kushite cultural can be found at the site.</p>
		 <p>This fort was filled with so much culture due to its location and importance. Tribes and states want to take power over its ports. The Nubians, Egyptian, Persians, Kushite and Saite all fought over the control of the fortress and it routes (Heidorn,1992). Traders brought in things such as animals, gold, iron and other goods from South Africa. The fortress was without a doubt a military outpost for the flow of traffic between Elephantine and Kushite.</p>
		 <p>The site itself dates back to the Third Intermediate all the way to the 27th dynasty, based of Lisa Heidorn findings of pottery. However the site shows signs to have been originally occupied as early as the late 8th century to early 7th century B.C. (Heidorn,1992). Nevertheless as the site continues to be excavated more artifacts our being found and linked to many different time periods in which the fort was occupied.</p>
		 <p>The structure of the fort however has been significantly altered over the few last centuries of its time, due to its occupancy. In the third intermediate the 27th dynasty links to Egyptian and Sudanese context were found (Heidorn,1991). From 700-525 BC the fort shows evidence of the Saite and Kushite periods. An in 525-400 BC it proves t be occupied by Persians.</p>

		  <h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>Dorginarti is divided into three specific levels, II-IV and structured out of mud brick. The fortress is located near the steep northern banks of the island, with about 400 meters separating it from the western shore (Heidorn,1992). This was measured in the 1960s by the Nile configuration; the distance as of today is unknown. The main gates on the west side of the fortress were put in place to take advantage of the harbor.</p>
         <p>Excavators also found the structure of a roadway leading westward and downward to a pottery-strewn riverbank. The remains of a glacis made of cataract stones were still in place causing the entire perimeter of the fort to still be visible. The walls however were preserved in places to a height of about six meters and measured up to eight meters thick (Heidorn,1992).</p>
         <p>The fortress also had a distinct triangular shaped which outlined the fort high ridges of cataract rock at the north of the island, with the highest knoll at the northeast supporting the Central and Eastern Sectors (Heidorn,1992). Theses ridges served as surveillance for the immediate area and were location of both the multi-storied Levels III and IV of the Official’s Residence and the Level II citadel.</p>
         <p>Level II of the Central Sector fortress was designed to both impress and to function as a genuine defense. The structure most likely functioned as police post, treasury, and reception hall. This sector also can be mainly dated back to the 6th and 5th centuries (Heidorn,1992).</p>
         <p>Level III was mostly made up of old ruins from Ramesses I and Ramesses IV structures in Buhen. These stolen blocks were used to make doorsills, jambs and lintels (Heidorn,1992).  It is said that this section of the fort was mainly used during the 8th and 7th century BC. This level obtained evidence of many amphorae fragments from Eastern Greek and Phoenician.</p>
         <p>Level IV southern part contained small workrooms, large silos, bins, ovens, houses, and two larger buildings of undefined function (Heidorn,1991).</p>

		 <h3>Excavation</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In 1964 James Knudstad provide a very detailed disruption of the site and its ruins. Richard Pierce who was the first to break ground right after finishing up an site near by (Heidorn,1992). He led a team from the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago to excavate the site. The initial excavation lasted from January to June of 1964. When excavators showed up to the site it was covered in sand and water damage from the continuous Nile flooding’s had destroyed a lot of the structure. The team was not even sure they could find anything. Parts of the western sector were even washed away in the floods (Heidorn, 1991).</p>
		 <br>
         <h3>Results</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>The excavation however was placed on hold due to the rise of the new Aswan High Dam. Most of the site however was excavated an only small sections were incomplete. During this short time of the excavation, researchers were able to find lots of information (Heidorn,1992). They learned that due to the flooding’s of the Nile the fort was abandoned and land routes were used instead. Also through Lisa discover of pottery they were able to determine the population of the fort and the main time periods of its use (Heidorn,1991). The artifacts found at the site show evidence of a substantial fortified settlement, which played an important role in the interaction between Nubia and Egypt in the first millennium BC. This relationship was also put on a restraint when the Nile began to flood.</p>
         <p>Some of the trenches that were excavated on the outside of the walls on the north, east, and south showed where walls bonded by stone stood around five meters tall. The few parts left untouched during the excavation were the river stairs, walls and much of level IV (Heidorn,1992).</p>

         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Dorginarti is one of the many fortresses along the Nile, known for its great protection and defense. The site itself is key to Egyptian archeology because of its significant role in the control of the trade route along the Nile, between Egypt and modern day Sudan.  Based off of the excavation archeologist were able to determine its major role in defense and how important it was to have control over the port between Southern Africa and the North (Heidorn,1992). Also the political power and relationships it helped build and destroy. Dorginarti was however not the only fort with this importance, neighboring fort Kulubnarti, Semna and Wadi Halfa played roles in its success.</p>
