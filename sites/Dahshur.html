      <h1>Dahshur</h1>
      <h3>Old Kingdom to Middle Kingdom</h3>
	  <h4>Julia Breza</h4>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr>
<p> The history of Dahshur spans a large section of the history of Egypt: from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom.  Located about thirty miles south west of Cairo, the city of Menshiyet Dahshur sits right on the edge of the cultivation.  Beyond that fertile zone, the pyramids and tombs of ancient Egyptian royals rise up out of the desert.  Dahshur is home to five pyramids that dominate the landscape inner dispersed among a mastaba field and Old Kingdom necropolis.</p>

<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
<hr>
<p> The history of Dahshur spans much of the history of Egypt: from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom.  Located about thirty miles south west of Cairo, the city of Dahshur sits right on the edge of the cultivation.  Beyond that fertile zone, the pyramids and tombs of ancient Egyptian royals rise up out of the desert.  </p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>The site of Dahshur is located outside of the city of Menshiyet Dahshur on the west bank of the Nile River in northern Egypt. The pyramid field consists of five different pyramids varying in color, size, and level of perseveration. Also located in the pyramid field are mastabas and a royal necropolis</p>
<p>Old Kingdom</p>
<p>Two of these pyramids were built by the Pharaoh Snefru during his reign in the Old Kingdom (4th dynasty).  He built the pyramids that are referred to as the Bend Pyramid and the Red Pyramid.  To the west of the White Pyramid (a middle kingdom pyramid) lies a mastaba field where a large number of royal family members are entombed. On the north side of the White Pyramid is a collection of tombs from this era. </p>
<p>Middle Kingdom</p>
<p> There are three different pyramids at Dahshur that were built during the Middle Kingdom.  Each of the three pharaohs that built at Dahshur during this kingdom belonged to the 12th dynasty.  The Black Pyramid was built by the Pharaoh Amenemhat III. The Black Pyramid is in the worse state of disrepair out of all pyramids at Dahshur.  The White Pyramid was built by Amenemhat II and sits in the middle of the pyramid field.  It is buffered to the north by old kingdom tombs and to the west by a collection of old kingdom mastabs.  Senwosret III built the third Middle Kingdom pyramid to the north east of the Red Pyramid.  In side of his pyramid complex contains a number of small pyramids for his queens.</p>

<h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Sir. William Flinders Petrie (1887):</p>
<p> Petrie worked on Dahshur in 1887 as part of a multi site excavation. He stared ff is Aswan before the military in Egypt had to close down his site due to security reasons.  He was not traveling alone; he brought another archaeologist with him: Mr. Griffin.  The two men split the work; Petrie worked on rock inscriptions whereas Mr. Griffin would work on tomb inscriptions.  When the pair made it to Dahshur, Petrie wanted to survey the entire site, but due to time constraints, he was only able to survey two of the ‘brick pyramids’ or more commonly referred to as ‘the bent or blunted pyramid’ as well as the smaller pyramid that adjoins it. </p>
<p> His extremely detailed publication of his 1887 season spent at Dahshur, details how precisely he measured and recorded his finding using a combination of the stars and geometry. He worked to describe the building technique used to build these two pyramids.  Using the knowledge he gained working at Cairo and Sakkara, he was able to date the two pyramids accordingly based on building techniques and the supplies used in the construction. </p>

<p> From his work it is now a detailed description of the pyramid of the size and composition of these two pyramids.  His work primarily focused on the building materials used on these two pyramids: from casing to core, he recorded the depth of the stones used for the various layers and eventually concluded that the bend pyramid and its small companion were not built on a solid foundation: they were built right on the sandy ground. (2)</p>

<br>
<p> Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan (1894-1895): </p>
<p> De Morgan made a number of fascinating discovers during his two year excavation at Dahshur.  His focus was the pyramid of Senwosret III and the smaller surrounding pyramids that were the final resting place of Senwosret III queens. His work led him to uncover the tombs of Princess Sithathor and Queen Meret.</p> 
<p>During his second at Dahshur, de Morgan was again looking for more royal burials that were at one point contained within the pyramid complex, but this time he was looking for burials around the pyramid of Amenemhet II (The White Pyramid).  He discovered the tombs of another queen: Queen Khenmet along with three of the pharaoh's daughters, the princesses Ita, Sithathormerit and Itweret.  He also discovered the tomb of chancellor Amenhotep in the same area.(1) </p>
<br>
<p> Rainer Stadelmann (Current:</p>
<p> Stadelmann is a German archaeologist who is considered to be an expert on excavations at the Giza plateau.  He has spent over a decade working at Dahshur, and has worked in conjunction with Diete Arnold on numerous occasions. He has directed the German Archaeological institute of Cairo since 1982, working at numerous sites in Egypt.  Stadelmann has worked almost exclusively with the Red Pyramid and the Bent Pyramid.</p>
<p> Stadelmann not only worked on the pyramids themselves, but he also looked at why Senefru wanted to build at Dahshur in the first place.  Throughout his work at Dahshur, Stadelmann wanted to know why Senefru would move from his current location (about 30 miles south of Dahshur) and also abandon a large step pyramid that he had just completed. One of the theories that Stadelmann helped raise was that perhaps Senefru wanted to be positioned closer to the Nile delta region of the country. Or that after his workers had completed one pyramid; Senefru was looking for a new goal to undertake to leave him mark on Egypt.  The second pyramid that he had built was the Bent Pyramid: this pyramid was built on a faulty surface, but if it was completed at the angle it was originally started at it would have been taller than the great pyramids at Giza.   (4)</p>
<br>
<p> Dieter Arnold (Current):</p>
<p> Arnold worked for the Metropolitan Museum of Art that currently sponsors expeditions in Dahshur as well as other sites around the world. Arnold’s work in Dahshur was started in 2001 when he decided to reopen a Middle Kingdom Mastaba of Khnumhotep III.  This mastaba had been previously worked on in 1894 by Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan. Morgan’s work focused on collecting fragments of text that were found on every surface of the mastaba, much like putting together a multimillion piece jigsaw puzzle. Arnold picked up where Morgan left off and discovered (and in some cases rediscovered) fragments of the mastaba inscriptions from all over the site including some that were buried in the floor under Morgan's expedition house. Even though incomplete, the writing on this mastaba is considered to be one of the more important middle Kingdom texts to date.(3) <p/>
<h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p> Sir. William Flinders Petrie (1887)</p>
<p> Petrie’s work at Dashur laid the foundation for the other archaeologists that followed him. Petrie was revolutionary in the way her surveyed archaeological sites and the massive amount of detail that he recorded in his field journals. His impact on the site of Dahshur can be seen in how other archaeologist’s refer back to his initial recordings made in the late nineteenth century to start their own excavations. He is also is credited with using pottery to date an archaeological site, this process is called ‘Seration’; this system is still used today.  He also trained the next generation of archaeologists to work in Egypt including Howard Carter.  For a time he also worked outside of Egypt trying to trace Egyptian culture into the Middle East.(5)</p>
<br>
<p> Jacques Jean Marie de Morgan (1894-1895):</p>
<p> The impact of De Morgan’s work at Dahshur can be seen in the funeral goods that he discovered dating from the Middle Kingdom.  The collection or jewelry and other treasures buried with the deceased princesses are some of the best examples of the Middle Kingdom. His finding of six preserved boats from this era has advanced the understanding of Egyptian engineering of the time.  These boats also are being studied to see where the various materials came from to make it.  This has told the academic community much about Egypt’s trade partners during the Middle Kingdom. (1) </p>
<br>
<p> Rainer Stadelmann:</p>
<p >His work on the red pyramid uncovered the corner stone of the pyramid that was labeled in reference to Senefru’s  time on the throne that he was able to date when they construction of the pyramid began.  He and his team were also able to identify section s in the limestone casing of the pyramid that also contained writing that referenced to when those stones were put in place. From this he was able to figure out when the construction for pyramid was started, and how long it took to complete.  Working with these fragments and others like them found at Dahshur, Stadelmann concluded that on about every tenth stone, the pharaoh would have his name etched into the surface.  This serves a number of proposes: it claimed the pyramid for the deceased pharaoh so that no other ruler will try to claim the pyramid as his or her own and it showed to other rulers the power that the particular pharaoh had during their rule. (4)</p>
<br>
<p> Dieter Arnold (2001-Current):</p>
<p> Arnold has contributed to the knowledge that the archaeological community has on Dahshur by filling in the gaps left by de Morgan when he was working with the Old Kingdom mastabs at Dahshur.  Arnold has also taken a special interest in the boat graves that were not fully studied my de Morgan.  His work has expanded on the pervious knowledge that was available about the Middle kingdom after the time that de Morgan spent there.  His ongoing excavations are focused on the boat graves: mostly on how they were constructed.  Not much is known about the engineering techniques that the ancient Egyptians used.  Out of the six boats that have been discovered between de Morgan and Arnold, five have been removed from the ground for perseveration and intensive study and one has been left in its original state at Dahshur to be studied there.  Finding preserved boat graves is a huge find:  there are stories of these boats being dug up and used as fire wood, leaving only bits and pieces of the boats remaining.(3) </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p> 	As seen through out the long history of research that has been conducted at Dahshur, this site has provided an insight into the lives of people who lived in the Old and Middle Kingdoms.  What is also very interesting about Dahshur is that archaeologists can see the advancements in Egyptian building techniques from one pharaoh to the next (or twice in one life time in the case of Senefru).  The many originations and archaeologists that are still working at Dahshur today shows that there is still much to be gained by studying this site and others like it.   </p>
