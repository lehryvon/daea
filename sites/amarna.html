<h1>Amarna</h1>
<h3>18th Dynasty</h3>
<h4>By: Tess Kilian</h4>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<hr>
<p>The site of Amarna, also called el-Amarna or Tell el-Amarna, was a city built around 1350
BC by King Akhenaten. The city was built as a new capital and for worship of the sun god, Aten.
After a period of occupation of 15 to 20 years, the site was deserted after the death of the
king Akhenaten. The short occupancy of the site, as well as the isolation of sections of Amarna, 
such as the Workmen’s Village, allow for a picture of life in Egypt during this time period.</p>
<p>Excavations of Amarna began in the 19th century and have continued, largely uninterrupted, 
until today. While sections of the site, like Workmen’s village have been extensively excavated, 
others, such as Stone Village, are just now beginning to undergo excavation. Evidence from 
already excavated areas, as well as evidence being discovered by recent excavations can help 
to shed light on the entire site of Tell el-Amarna. Additionally, excavations of both of these
villages, within the larger site of Amarna, may give evidence to the lives of the non-elite 
and what the inhabitants of the villages did with their daily lives.</p>
<br>
<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>

<p>Amarna is located on the east bank of the Nile at the border of Middle and Upper Egypt,
in the province of El-Minia.It is approximately 312 kilometers south of Cairo. The site is on 
a wide plain with cliffs on either side that descend almost into the river. Sand and debris 
deposited from the Nile cover the plain. The plain is about 10 kilometers long and five 
kilometers wide. The ground slopes into the river and the soil consists of yellow sand. 
Surrounding the plain are four valleys and torrent beds. In the middle of the east side lies 
a valley that Akhenaten selected for his tomb. There are three depressions in the limestone 
strata. The strata, which are level on either side curve down suddenly to a depth of about 200 
feet (Petrie 2013).</p>
<br>
<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>The site itself is about 10 kilometers long and five kilometers wide. Much of the western
side of the city has disappeared due to modern cultivation. However, a large portion of the 
city has been preserved in the desert to the east. Two sets of rock monuments occupy the site. 
One is the Boundary Stelae and the other is two groups of rock tombs, the North Tombs and the 
South Tombs. A third group of rock cut tombs includes the Royal Tombs. Ancient quarries are 
preserved toward the northern area of the site (Amarna Project).</p>
<p>There are three areas of planned settlement at Amarna. One is a block of terraced buildings
in the middle of the city. There is also a rectangular settlement that is walled and about one
kilometer east of the main part of the city (Shaw 1995). This is now known as the Workmen’s
Village, previously known as Eastern Village. An area of temporary living also existed about
halfway between the Workmen’s Village and the cliffs. Workmen’s Village was built on one 
branch of a shallow Y-shaped valley. A walled settlement is contained within Workmen's Village.
A more isolated settlement, known as Stone Village, is located near Workmen’s Village. 
(Kemp 1978).</p>
<p>The main city is badly eroded and covered in sand. Stonework from the city has long since 
been removed and the elements have reduced the city to ruins. The city is divided into zones. 
These are the Central City, which was occupied by main palaces and administrative buildings. 
An area of houses was known as the Main City. South of this, and less developed was the South 
Suburb. The North Suburb is located north of the Central City. Further north is the North 
Palace and at the base of the cliffs lays the North City (Amarna Project).</p>
<br>
<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
<hr>
<p>William Flinders Petrie was present in 1891 when archaeological excavations in Amarna
began. Amarna was excavated by both German and British expeditions almost continuously 
from 1891 until 1936. In the 1920s work was begun on Workmen’s Village, although at the 
time it was referred to as Eastern Village. These excavations were carried out by T.E. 
Peet and Leonard Woolley. These excavations took place mainly within the walled 
settlement of Workmen’s Village, also focusing on some nearby chapels and tombs 
(Stevens 2011). In the 1921-1922 excavations, a wooden pedestal was found with a man’s 
name and the title of “Servant of the Place”. This is a title that is similar to one used 
frequently by workmen at Deir el-Medina, a village of workers who built tombs. This is a 
significant piece of evidence that suggests that those living in Workmen’s Village were 
workers and artists employed in cutting and decorating rock tombs (Kemp 1984).</p>

</figure>
<p>The Egypt Exploration Society resumed excavations of the site in 1977. The survey
of the site in 1977 was carried out by Barry J. Kemp and the Inspector of Antiquities, 
Mohammed Abd el-Aziz. The main purpose of this first season of work was to create a 
more detailed and accurate map of the entire site, as well as to consider the potential 
for further excavation of the site (Kemp 1978). Beginning in 1979 excavations were 
concentrated primarily in the Workmen’s Village and continued for five seasons until 
the first report was published on the entire site of Amarna in 1984. The walled village 
within Workmen’s Village is 70 meters square and consists of 73 house plots of identical 
size. There was only a single gateway leading through the walled village and approximately 
300-400. It appears from evidence that food and water were delivered to the village 
regularly. Cattle, goat, and pig were domesticated at the village and two buildings were 
identified as animal pens.</p>
<p>A military standard was found during the excavations of Workmen’s Village in the 1970s
and 1980s. This evidence suggests that perhaps Workmen’s Village was used to house guards
or soldiers. However, it is unclear when this may have occurred. Although these alternative 
explanations for the village exist, that the residents of the village were rock tomb workers 
is often preferred. It is stated by Kemp in the first Amara Report that the purpose of the 
existence of Workmen’s Village is complicated by that of a smaller, unexcavated nearby village, 
now known as Stone Village (Kemp 1984).</p>
<p>Excavations at Amarna are on-going. The first excavations of Stone Village began in 2005
and in 2012 an excavation and re-examination of the Great Aten Temple began (Amarna Project).
Stone Village is still relatively unknown and one of the least understood areas of the city, 
as it has only recently begun to undergo excavation. The Stone Village Survey took place 
from 2005-2009 and consisted of documentation of surface remains, as well as the excavation 
of nine trenches. Largely the result of looting, limestone boulders, sherds, and mounds of 
orange clay litter the ground at the site. Recent fieldwork at Stone Village has given 
evidence that it housed a permanent population. It was also found that in contrast of 
Workmen’s Village, Stone Village’s ground plan and architecture were organized. Evidence 
from burials has also shown that a mixed population of men, women, and children occupied 
Stone Village. Both village show signs of being involved in tomb making, therefore the 
question that arises is why the city would support two villages that did the same work. 
It is suggested that the sites may not be contemporary. Additionally, the social status 
of the two villages appears to be different. Stevens (2011) suggests that those in Workmen’s 
Village worked on the royal tombs, thereby giving them a higher social standing than those 
in Stone Village. For now, bringing the relationship of the two villages to light is not 
possible. As more work is done on Stone Village in the future, perhaps it can also shed 
light on the role of Workmen’s Village.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>Built as the capital of a new kingship and religious order, the site of Tell el-Amarna 
offers insight into this period of change in Egypt. The fact that it was also only occupied 
for the short span of a generation and has largely avoided resettlement have allowed 
archaeologists to shed light on a particular period of time in Egyptian history. Excavations
of isolated villages, such as Stone Village and Workmen’s Village, have also begun to uncover
the reasons for the existence of these villages, as well as their relationship to each other.</p>
