<h1>Kerma</h1>
<h3>Old Kingdom to New Kingdom</h3>
<h4>Caitlin Woolsey</h4>
<h3>Itroduction</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Kerma is a Nubian City and capital Of the Kushite Kingdom. Kerma has within it many different sites that span a very long period of time. This site is an important one because of not only the presence of Egyptian artifacts, but because of the vast number of burials associate with Kerma. The link between Kerma and Egypt is an interesting one. Egyptian text mention the Kush, but do not mention anything about their culture. This lack of detail makes Kerma very interesting because we can learn more about this relatively elusive people. They were trade partners and sometimes military rivals with Egypt. Providing a lot of the raw materials such as animals, gold, and ebony that the Egyptians wanted. This relationship with Egypt gave way to a very prosperous time that allowed the area to expand. Occasionally the trade relationship between these different nations was disturbed by military attacks during times of "political upheaval".</p>
<p>The burials on the site are what are of a particular interest to most involved. While the main burial, inside of the mud-brick temples, have been heavily luted the discovery of hundreds of other burials, many undisturbed presented a vast amount of information, but how this information has been interpreted by archeologist differs. Many clearly Egyptian artifacts have caused slight confusion about Kerma, How the people lived, what their culture was like, and how close their ties to Egypt really were.   </p>
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
<h3>Geography</h3>
<hr>
<p>Kerma located in Northern Sudan, along the Nile Valley . The areas surrounding the site are rugged and very rocky. Kerma however, is a very fertile and wide plain. People were attracted to the site because of large mud-brick structures that were rising out of the ground. (1) The city is built around this mud-brick temple. Its location along the Nile made it an easy for the Egyptians to trade with, and also made it a very fertile area. Todays site is near to urban life, and is separated by a nice amount of trees from the neighboring population. </p>
<br>
<h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr>
<p>There are several sites within Kerma, Dukki Gel, the City of Kerma, Pre-Kerma Agglomeration, El-Barga, Wadi El-Arab, Busharia, Kaddanarti, and the Kerma Necropolis (2). A majority of the sites contain human remains. Moat notably the Kerma Necropolis, which is to the East of the City.  The Site of Dukki Gel is of great importance to Egypt, because it is the city set up by the Eighteenth Dynasty pharos who conquered the area. all of the sites show different periods, different activities, and social order that was happening in the very vast history of Kerma. From the pre-Kerma period to the Final Kerma period. a history that spans over a thousand years. </p>
<br>
<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Kerma has been undergoing excavations for quite some time. The first to excavate the site was George Reisenr between 1913 and 1916. He was not even meaning to go to this site but was side tracked on his way to a different site and ended up staying, never making it to his original destination of Sesi. During his three year excavation He found around 1000 bodies and 5000 artifacts (5). what he found was Many artifacts that appeared to be Egyptian in origin mixed in with many of the undisturbed burials. This lead him to theorize about the connection with Egypt, that the area of Kerma may have had. While his theories have been picked apart, his original findings and his ideas behind the site have been prevalent in understanding more about the site, and his theories are still debated and questioned today.</p>
<p>Within the city, there are signs of workshops, religious centers, and the homes show that there was a kind of social stratification. There is a distinct type of architecture, that grows and becomes more defined as time goes on and Kerma becomes more powerful. Mud-brick structures appear relatively early in the history of Kerma, but the structures start out relatively small (1). The town is different compared to Egypt in its layout. It is not highly organized, but instead it is random and not preplanned. In the city there is evidence of private worship, as well as public spaces for worship. There is evidence for some religious areas to be covered in ochre, which was also used in a religious context by the Egyptians (1). Surrounding the city are large ditches, upon excavation of these ditches it became clear that it was a wall meant to fortify the city, probably from Egyptian attacks. There is evidence that this type of fortification was necessary as there are signs of attack and fire in the town, thought to be from the Egyptians (5)   </p>
<p>Later in 1977 The Kerma Necropolis was Excavated by French Archeologist B. Gratien (1), with about 30000 to 4000 burials being found. The site was approached area by are because of how large it is (2). The dig, which was simultaneous to a dig of the city of Kerma, lasted about 15 years. At the Necropolis all of the burials run in a grid that is parallel to the Nile. Black and white stones are alined in circles to signify the burials. There is a basic pattern seen within the graves of people, there are limited items within the graves from what appears to be the earlier period, but more seems to be added in later burials. Even within time periods there can be seen a relatively distinct difference between some of the graves, that seem to be based on a social hierarchy. (1)</p> 
<p>The later site of Dukki Gel,  is of a town set up by the pharaohs of Egypt who conquered Kerma, and with this settlement comes a lot of interesting artifacts. Dukki Gel has only been excavated in more recent years (2). Because of its more recent discovery, not a lot has been done yet about this site. The site contains workshops for things like bread and beer. One of the more interesting parts of the site which Archeologist have focused on is the temples and the areas surrounding them(2). </p>  
<br>
<h3>Importance of Excavations</h3>
<hr> 
<p>The Kush kingdom was an adversary and partner to Ancient Egypt. While we know about them from the Egyptian text the Egyptians never mention anything about their culture or who they were as people. By looking at Kerma we are able to see what these people were actually like and we are able to find out more about their relationship with Egypt. Egypt's involvement or lack of has all been pushed by the original conclusions of the site drawn by Reisenr. We know that the Kush kingdom was influenced by the Egyptians from the findings of Kerma, but the amount at which Egypt effected the culture is still hotly debate. It is unsure weather the artifacts found are result of Egyptians making the products or is its the result of the people learning the Egyptian way of making these items (4).</p>
<p>The relationship with Egypt goes beyond that of just the artifacts, from the obvious signs of attack as well as what we know from written record, we can see the signs of the military turmoil between these two nations, even after the area was conquered by Egypt. There are signs of pockets of resistance even once Thutmose 1 and his successors gained control of Kerma. But what seems to be really interesting is that at The Cite of Dukki Gel the statues found of the black pharos have been purposefully broken at the neck, in an attempt to destroy the power of the pharaoh (2). These Statues were of "Taharqo and Tanwetamani and three of their sucessors"(2). These statues have helped expand our understanding of what was happening at Dukki Gel. it is thought that the statues were "broken during Pasamtik II's raid on Nubia"(2). </p>
<p>In the burials of the people at Kerma there is a very obvious social stratification happening. It is interesting however that this difference is much more obvious in the Burials than it is in the homes of the people. It is interesting and says a lot about the people of this time. The stratification seems in increase over time, which is a relatively common trend. </p>
<br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>While we have learned A lot from the Site of Kerma there is still much to be learned. After a 100 years there is still many debates and questions we need to resolve. For such an important site with so many artifacts and so much information there is a lot that still needs to be studied about Kerma. We know that the relationship between Egypt and the Kush is a very complicated one, with times of joint prosperity and times of fall out and military action. We see in the site, the relationship played out, even when Tutmosis 1 had conquered the area. </p>
